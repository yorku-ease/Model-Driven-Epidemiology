## 2b. Three-layer gap analysis

*Matches the paper framework: gaps between specification, extraction, and validation.*

| Layer | Description | C | P | F | Total |
|-------|-------------|---|---|---|-------|
| **Spec → Model** | Recognised from paper text but absent from model | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Model → Gold** | Reference model items absent from extraction | 3 | 9 | 6 | 18 |
| **Extra in model** | Model items not in reference (noise/convention) | 2 | 15 | 2 | 19 |

## 5. Gap filling results
- Filled via **RAG**: 19
- Filled via **paper entities (spec)**: 0
- Filled via **inference**: 5
- **Flagged** for manual review: 0

### maternalprotected (missing_compartments)
- **Source:** inference
- **Primary name:** Maternally Protected

### vaccinatedonedose (missing_compartments)
- **Source:** inference
- **Primary name:** VaccinatedOneDose
- **Reasoning:** The paper differentiates between 'first-dose coverage' and 'second MMR dose', indicating a need to model individuals who have received only one dose of the vaccine.
