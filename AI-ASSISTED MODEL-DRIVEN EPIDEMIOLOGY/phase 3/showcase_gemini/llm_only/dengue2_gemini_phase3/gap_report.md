## 2b. Three-layer gap analysis

*Matches the paper framework: gaps between specification, extraction, and validation.*

| Layer | Description | C | P | F | Total |
|-------|-------------|---|---|---|-------|
| **Spec → Model** | Recognised from paper text but absent from model | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Model → Gold** | Reference model items absent from extraction | 4 | 5 | 5 | 14 |
| **Extra in model** | Model items not in reference (noise/convention) | 0 | 13 | 2 | 15 |

## 5. Gap filling results

### vaccinebreakthroughrate (missing_parameters)
- **Source:** inference
- **Value:** None 
- **Reasoning:** No default in library; manual lookup required.
- **Confidence:** LOW

## 6. Fill validation (vs gold standard)
