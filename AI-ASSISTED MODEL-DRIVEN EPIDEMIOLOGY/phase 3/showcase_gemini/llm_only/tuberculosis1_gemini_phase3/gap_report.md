- **Flagged** for manual review: 0

### Susceptible->Infected (missing_flows)
- **Source:** inference
- **Flow type:** ContactFlow
- **Description:** Susceptible individuals become infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis through contact with infectious individuals.
- **Reasoning:** Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that spreads through person-to-person transmission, making the Susceptible to Infected transition a contact-dependent process.

### Infected->Recovered (missing_flows)
- **Source:** inference
- **Flow type:** RateFlow
- **Description:** The rate at which infected individuals recover from tuberculosis, either naturally or through treatment, and are no longer infectious.
- **Reasoning:** Tuberculosis is a treatable disease, and individuals can recover from infection, which is a fundamental process in disease dynamics models.

### Recovered->Infected (missing_flows)
- **Source:** inference
- **Flow type:** ContactFlow
- **Description:** Recovered individuals can

## 7. Structural alignment vs gold (compartments & flows)
