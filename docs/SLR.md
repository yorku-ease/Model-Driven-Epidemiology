# This document presents the evolution of the [Systematic Literature Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review)

### Query

We are looking to integrate a few aspects key to [MDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) as part of the software research.

It is quite hard to formulate exact "Research Questions", the first step of an SLR, but we do have concerns that can be easily identified.

Basically our main concern is: What is the best way to make an epidemiological modeling software? Expert knowledge answers that MDE is appropriate.

Let's instead identify software specific parts of the MDE process, and of our project, that warrant some research:

- Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)
- Model Evolution
- Model Version Control
- Software Product Lines

Epidemiology is, of course, a very important part of the project, but has little to offer for a software researcher. In a final phase of Literature Review, we will try including epidemiological keywords to the queries.

Now the first step is to formulate a query that encompasses our research areas:

# [TODO](TODO)

And the second is to identify sources of articles, we chose:

- https://www.springer.com/gp
- https://dl.acm.org/
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp
- https://www.elsevier.ca/ca/
- https://www.engineeringvillage.com/home.url
