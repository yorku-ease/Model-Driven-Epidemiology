## Introduction

The following document presents the Requirements for the epidemiological modeling software to be develloped. It consists of mainly 2 sections. The first is the funtional requirements, referring to the capabilities of the system, in other words the features. Secondly, nonfunctional requirements referring to the way some features are implemented. Essentially they form respectively the "What" and "How" of the project.

### Project Objective

The objective is to provide the client with a framework to develop, view, compare, modify and test epidemiological models. This will be done using either the Domain Specific Language we will develop, or the graphical editor/viewer.

The training of models has to do with other software using machine learning which will not be part of this project, but a certain integration between the developped software and the training software has to be made available to minimize complexity during that transfer step from our representation of a model to a trainable representation. Visualizing predictions (curves, time series) will be part of the solution, but not training.

### Context

This is a masters project at Polytechnique Montreal, currently undertaken by a single student for a single "client", an epidemiologist, professor at the University of Montreal. There are no business collaborators. The project revolves mostly about implementing the required features, but partially about researching how to best do so following Model Driven practices.
