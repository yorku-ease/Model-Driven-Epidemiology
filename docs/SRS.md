## Introduction

The following document presents the Requirements for the epidemiological modeling software to be develloped. It consists of mainly 2 sections. The first is the funtional requirements, referring to the capabilities of the system, in other words the features. Secondly, nonfunctional requirements referring to the way some features are implemented. Essentially they form respectively the "What" and "How" of the project. The goal of the project is to provide the client with a framework to develop, view, compare, modify and test epidemilogical models.

### Context

This is a masters project, currently undertaken by a single student for a single "client", an epidemiologist, professor at the University of Montreal. There are no business collaborators. The project revolves mostly about implementing the required features, but partially about researching how to best do so following Model Driven practices.
